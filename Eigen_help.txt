Example eigen install

NB: This is just for guidance and may or may not be up-to-date

After downloading the current tar ball from _ follow these steps (changing file names where necessary)

tar -xzvf eigen-eigen-323c052e1731.tar.gz
cd ./eigen-eigen-323c052e1731/
cp -r ./Eigen /usr/local/include #This may require sudo privileges 

Provided that the Eigen headers directory has been successfully transfered to /usr/local/include (and all other dependencies are met) NUQA should successfully compile.
